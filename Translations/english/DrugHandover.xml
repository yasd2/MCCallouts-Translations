                <Dialogue>Hello, thanks for joining us.</Dialogue>
                <Dialogue>This briefing is intended to give you an overview of what's going on.</Dialogue>
                <Dialogue>We have reports of a illegal drug handover taking place today at the Sandy Shores Airfield.</Dialogue>
                <Dialogue>Since you're one of the best trained sniper elites, your job is to scout and call us once a drug deal is made.</Dialogue>
                <Dialogue>We will then come in hot with 2 unmarked units and 1 swat bearcat. If we're taking fire, your job is to take them out.</Dialogue>
                <Dialogue>We have spotted a good sniper position for you on one of the buildings next to the airfield.</Dialogue>
                <Dialogue>But for now, first choose a sniper, for that in the police station right there on the table.</Dialogue>
